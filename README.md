## How to use app
### How to install
  Install LINE application.
  Follow the account by scanning QR code below.
### How to start
  When you create tasks : Type “New Task”
  Follow the instructions of flex message.

## Key Focus of Points
I focused on the design of the flex message. The first flex message is sent, and when the second flex message comes back, a gauge is displayed to indicate how many more items are needed to create the task. This makes it clear to the user how many more items they need to enter, and prevents an increase in user abandonment.
I built the application so that the rich menu reflects the task name, time, and priority sent by the user.
In this case, we created a rich menu and also built the app so that users can use the functions by simply pressing the menu button.
## Future Improvement
Next feature to be added: We would like to add a feature that will tally the number of tasks, and time, accomplished this week, and return a message to the user. Visualizing the results will help users stay motivated.
I would also like to add a feature that allows users to view a list of tasks that are not performed during the day in a list. The reason is that I often do this and having that list in front of me prevents the temptation to go off and concentrate on executing the task.
